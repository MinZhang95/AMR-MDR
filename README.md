# AMR-MDR
Antimicrobial multidrug resistance

In this research, we provide a Bayesian framework that estimates the resistance level jointly for antibiotics belonging to different classes with a Gaussian mixture model. The research article can be access once it is published. 

This GitHub repository mainly contains the R code used for

* Data cleaning 
* Bayesian model construction (.stan)
* Model implementation with real datasets
* Simulation studies.
